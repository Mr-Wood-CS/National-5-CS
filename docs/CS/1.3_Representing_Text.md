# Storing Characters - ASCII

When you are using a program and you press a key on the keyboard the program has to have some way of identifying which key you pressed. 

This is true for any program whether it is a word processing package, spreadsheet or game. 

Each character on the keyboard has a unique binary code allocated to it.

This is called ASCII. It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 

ASCII can represent 256 characters. 

ASCII code includes:

* Non-printing characters: <return>, <tab>

* Numbers: 0-9

* Upper and Lower Case Letters: A-Z, a-z

* Punctuation and other symbols: $, %, !, ?, @

All of the above are examples of the character set. 

This is the group of letters and numbers and characters that a computer can represent and manipulate. 


!!! info "Exam Tip"

    In you exam you are highly unlikely to get a question on control characters. You are more likely to recieve a question that: 

    * asks you to provide the leter A in binary. 

    * asks how many letters can be reprsented by extended ASCII (`255`)

    * asks how many bits are used to display "Hello" (`8 bits per letter so "Hello = 5 * 8"`)

    I have added the main symbols/characters below. Try to memorise the decimal number of each sequence, from there you can just continue the sequence.

    === "0-9"
