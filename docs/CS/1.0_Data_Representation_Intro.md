# Introduction

Computer Systems covers all of the super-fast, minute workings, inside devices.  We study the various technological devices and equipment we rely on and use every day through to all-encompassing networks we are ever connected through.

Everything in devices is kept and worked with in Binary numbers, 1s and 0s.  

A single instruction, of the millions of lines of programming running in memory, can take up 64 bits (binary digits) each.  

The multimedia data you use in your programs also range from a few hundred bits for a text file all the way through to billions and billions of bits for a full movie. 

The number of bits required to be processed and stored is mind blowing in our ever-shrinking devices.  It does not seem sensible or simple to us, but Binary is actually very easy to represent in electronics using a high voltage for 1 and a low voltage for 0.  The super speeds of our devices mean they can work with billions of bits per second.
