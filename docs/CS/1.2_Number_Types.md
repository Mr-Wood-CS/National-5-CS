# Floating Point Representation

Now that we know how to representent positive whole numbers we now have to consider how to represent very large and very small numbers. 

If we used conventional binary methods, then too much memory would be used just to represent numbers.

The technique used to solve this problem is similar to standard form, which you are taught in mathematics, and it is called floating point representation.

In standard form you are taught to write the number `421212.79` as:

      ![](Images/Mantissa_and_Exponent_1.png){ width="500" }
</figure>

!!! info 

    The rule is to place the decimal point just after the first digit and to count the number of places that it has been moved. This number is then written as the power. In this case the point was moved five places.
 
Now that we have looked at how floating point representation is used with decimal numbers we now need to understand how it is used with binary. 

When using binary we just follow the same process as binary has a binary point just like a decimal point.

For example, the binary number `1101.001101110010` is written as:

<figure markdown="span">
      ![](Images/Mantissa_and_Exponent_2.png){ width="800" }
</figure>



Notice that we have **`moved the binary point four places`** but the **`exponent is written as 00000100`**. 

**This is not one hundred; it is the number 4 in binary.**

In the example above we have allocated 2 bytes for the mantissa and 1 byte for the exponent. Computers more commonly allow 4 bytes for the mantissa and at least 1 byte for the exponent.


The computer only needs to store the value of the mantissa and the exponent to represent any real number. 

Computers use floating point is easy to implement and saves storage space.

!!! warning "Remember"

    The exponent is the number of places you have moved the decimal point to the left.
