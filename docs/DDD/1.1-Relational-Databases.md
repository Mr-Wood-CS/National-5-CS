# Relational Databases

## Explanation

### Relational Databases

A relational database consists of two or more tables that are linked through relationships between their data sets.

!!! note 
    When designing your database the words `Table`and`Field` are refered to as `Entities` and `Attrbutes`. It is important that you remember this difference as it often causes confusion when it comes to actually building your database.
