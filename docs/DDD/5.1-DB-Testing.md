# Testing

## Explanation

Testing ensures that a database and its queries work correctly and return accurate results. Without testing, errors could lead to incorrect data retrieval, processing, or even data loss.

Testing helps to:

* Identify and fix errors in SQL queries.
* Ensure queries return the expected results.
* Verify that the database structure meets requirements.
* Improve database performance and efficiency.

## Types of Testing

1. Syntax Testing - Checks that SQL commands follow the correct rules and structure. If there are mistakes in SQL keywords, punctuation, or spelling, an error message will appear.

2. Execution Testing (Functional Testing) - Ensures that queries return the expected results.
Uses sample data to check if the query outputs correct and complete results.

3. Normal, Extreme, and Exceptional Testing. To fully test a query, different types of data must be used:

    1. Normal Data (Valid Data) – Typical inputs that should work. 

    2. Extreme Data (Edge Cases) – Values at the limits of what the database should handle. 

    3. Exceptional Data (Invalid Data) – Inputs that should cause an error or be rejected.
