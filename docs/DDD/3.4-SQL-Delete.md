# SQL DELETE Operations

You can use SQL to delete a record from a database. 

```pseudocode title="Delete Syntax" linenums="1"
DELETE SYNTAX
DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME
WHERE CONDITION;
```

On the pupil database we could delete a specific pupils record using the following SQL.

```sql title="Delete Records" linenums="1"
DELETE FROM Pupils 
WHERE name = "Bob Jordan";
```

The above SQL would delete Bob Jordanâ€™s record from the database. Note that this is permanent once ran so be sure to have a backup copy of your database. 

!!! warning "Warning" 
    The above will delete `ANY` records it finds with the name `Bob Jordan`. Make sure there is only ONE `Bob Jordan` before running your query.
