# Types of Validation

There are four types of validation we need to know for National 5:

# Presence check	

Checks that a field can’t be left blank.

This is common on a form, when you don’t want fields left blank.

Write “presence check” in the validation column.

Length check	Checks that the data must be a certain length, e.g. a password has to be at least 6 characters, or a car registration must be exactly 7 characters.

Write “length check” in the validation column:
●	Length check, = 6 characters
●	Length check, >= 5 characters
●	Length check, >= 3 and <= 7
Range check	Range checks that a number or date is between two points - for example, that a star rating is between 1 and 5.

Write “range check” in the validation column:
●	Range check, > 5
●	Range check, < 10
●	Range check, >= 1 and <= 5
Restricted choice	Restricted choice is when you only want the user to choose between options. For example:

●	A person’s title being Mr, Mrs, Dr, Rev, etc.
●	Pupils in a class list sitting only N4, N5 or Higher
●	A product only comes in certain colours. A customer chooses which colour they want when ordering.
