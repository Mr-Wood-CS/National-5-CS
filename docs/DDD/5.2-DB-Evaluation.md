# Evaluation

Once testing is complete, the database must be evaluated to ensure it meets all requirements. 

Evaluation involves checking the following key aspects:

1. Does the Database Meet User Requirements?

    1. Does it store all necessary data?
    2. Do queries return the correct results?
    3. Are relationships between tables correctly defined?

2. Is the Database Efficient?

    1. Do queries execute quickly?
    2. Are only the necessary columns selected? (e.g., avoiding SELECT * when specific fields are needed)
    3. Are indexes used effectively to speed up searches?

3. Is the Database Secure?

    1. Are access rights correctly configured?
    2. Can unauthorized users modify or access data?

4. Is the Data Accurate and Reliable?

    1. Does the data reflect real-world values?
    2. Are there any errors in the query results?


If the system does not meet these expectations, it may be difficult to use and require modifications.

## Applying Evaluation in Your Coursework

In the National 5 Computing Science exam, you may be given database tables along with SQL queries. You will need to:

* Predict the expected outcome of the queries.
* Identify any errors or issues in the SQL statements.
* Explain what is wrong and suggest how to fix it.
* By understanding how to test and evaluate a database system, you will be well-prepared to analyze database queries and improve system functionality.
