# SQL INSERT, UPDATE AND DELETE Operations 

## INSERT Operations

The `INSERT` statement in SQL is used to add new records to a table. It specifies the table name, the columns to be filled, and the values to be inserted. For example:

```pseudocode title="Insert Syntax" linenums="1"
INSERT INTO entity (attribute1, attribute2, attribute3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, â€¦);
```

## UPDATE Operations

The UPDATE statement in SQL is used to modify existing records in a table. It specifies the table name, the columns to be updated, the new values, and a WHERE clause to filter the affected rows. For example:

```pseudocode title="Update Pupils Database" linenums="1"
UPDATE entity name
SET column1 = ...
WHERE column1 = ...;
```

## DELETE Operations

The `DELETE` statement in SQL is used to remove records from a table based on a specified condition. It includes the `WHERE` clause to define which rows should be deleted. For example: You can use SQL to delete a record from a database. 

```pseudocode title="Delete Syntax" linenums="1"
DELETE FROM entity name
WHERE column1 CONDITION ...;
```

!!! warning "Warning" 
    Delete will delete `ANY` records for the condition you have set. Always check twice before running a `DELETE` operation.
