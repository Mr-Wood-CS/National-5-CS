# SQL Select Operations

At National 5 you are required to be able to carry out various operations on a database using the SQL language, Conditional Operators and Logical Operators. 

The first operations we will look at is `SELECT...FROM...` and `SELECT... FROM... WHERE...` operations including `ORDER BY`

## SELECT...FROM...

SELECT...FROM... is used to return complete data sets from an entity. These data sets can either be the whole entity or select colmuns.

The syntax below demonstrates how a a SELECT...FROM... query works:

``` sql title="EXAMPLE 1 - SELECT...FROM..." linenums="1"
SELECT * -- returns all data from the entity
FROM entity_name;
```
``` sql title="EXAMPLE 2 - SELECT...FROM..." linenums="1"
SELECT column1, column2 -- column1, column2, are the attribute names of the entity you want to select data from. 
FROM entity_name;
```

## SELECT...FROM...WHERE...

The `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE` statement in SQL is used to retrieve specific data from a table based on defined conditions. `SELECT `specifies the columns to be retrieved, `FROM`indicates the table from which the data is pulled, and `WHERE` filters the results by applying conditions. For example:

``` sql title="SELECT...FROM...WHERE" linenums="1"
SELECT column1, column2, column 3 
FROM entity name 
WHERE column 3 > ...;
```

### Conditional Operators

Conditional operators in SQL are used to apply conditions and control the flow of data retrieval or manipulation based on certain criteria. 

These operators help filter, compare, and return specific values or perform specific actions depending on conditions. 

``` sql title="Conditional Operators" linenums="1"
=  --  Equal to
>  --  Greater than
<  --  Less than
>= --  Greater than or equal to
<= --  Less than or equal to
<> --  Not equal to
```
### Logical Operators (AND, OR) 

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause.

``` sql title="Logical Operators" linenums="1"
AND -- Returns true if all conditions are true.
OR  -- Returns true if at least one condition is true.
```
### ORDER BY

The `ORDER BY` clause in SQL is used to sort query results in either ascending `(ASC)` or descending `(DESC)` order. 

By default, `ORDER BY` sorts in ascending order if `ASC `is not specified. For example:

``` sql title="ORDER BY Ascending (ASC)" linenums="1"
SELECT column1,column2, column3
FROM entity name
ORDER BY column3 ASC;
```

``` sql title="ORDER BY Ascending (DESC)" linenums="1"
SELECT column1,column2, column3
FROM entity name
ORDER BY column3 DESC;
```

## Example - Pupils Database

In the example below the `Pupils` database contains the attributes `name, age and guidance house`. 

==Entity/Table Name = Pupils==

| StudentNum | Name            | Age | House
| -----------| --------------- | --- | -----
| 1          | Stephen Stewart | 13  | Nevis
| 2          | Lynsey MacG     | 15  | Rannoch
| 3          | Daniel Kerr     | 17  | Lochiel
| 4          | Bob Jordan      | 11  | Nevis
| 6          | Eilidh Ralston  | 16  | Nevis

### Example SQL SELECT Operations on the Pupil Databse

=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title=" Select All" linenums="1"
    SELECT * 
    FROM Pupils;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out all the information in the database called Pupils using an astrix `*`
<br>
=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="Equals" linenums="1"
    SELECT * 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE House = 'Nevis';
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the pupils who are in the guidance house Nevis from the Pupils table. Note there is speech marks around a string value.
<br>
=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title=" Greater Than" linenums="1"
    SELECT name, age 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age > 15;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the attributes name and age from the Pupils table where the age is greater than or equal to 12.
<br>
=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="Less Than" linenums="1"
    SELECT name, age 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age < 15;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the attributes name and age from the Pupils table where the age is greater than or equal to 12.
<br>
=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="Greater Than or Equal too" linenums="1"
    SELECT name, age 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age >= 12;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the attributes name and age from the Pupils table where the age is greater than or equal to 12.
<br>

=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="Less Than or Equal too" linenums="1"
    SELECT name, age 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age <= 15;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the attributes name and age from the Pupils table where the age is greater than or equal to 12.
<br>
=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="AND" linenums="1"
    SELECT * 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age >= 12 AND age <= 16;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the pupils who are aged greater than or equal to 16 and in guidance house Lochiel from the Pupils table.
<br>

=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="OR" linenums="1"
    SELECT * 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age >= 12 OR age <= 16;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the pupils who are aged greater than or equal to 16 and in guidance house Lochiel from the Pupils table.
<br>
=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="Show Results in Ascending" linenums="1"
    SELECT name, age, house 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age < 15
    ORDER BY age ASC;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out the attributes name, age and house from the pupils table that are less than 15 years old. The results will be sorted by the age attribute in ascending order.
<br>

=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="Show Results in Descending Order" linenums="1"
    SELECT name, age, house 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age < 15
    ORDER BY age DESC;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out the attributes name, age and house from the pupils table that are less than 15 years old. The results will be sorted by the age attribute in ascending order.
