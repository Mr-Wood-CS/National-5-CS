# SQL SELECT OPERATIONS

For N5 you are required to be able to carry out various operations on a database using the SQL language. 

The first operations we will look at is select operations.

```sql linenums="1"
SELECT SYNTAX
SELECT column1, column2, …
FROM table_name;
```
Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. 

If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:

```sql linenums="1"
SELECT * 
FROM table_name;
```
An example below shows a Pupil Info database with attributes name, age and guidance house. 

==Entity/Table Name = Pupils==

| StudentNum | Name            | Age | House
| -----------| --------------- | --- | -----
| 1          | Stephen Stewart | 13  | Nevis
| 2          | Lynsey MacG     | 15  | Rannoch
| 3          | Daniel Kerr     | 17  | Lochiel
| 4          | Bob Jordan      | 11  | Nevis
| 6          | Eilidh Ralston  | 16  | Nevis
   

## Task 

1. Open [OneCompiler](https://onecompiler.com/mysql/4399nm5az). 

2. On the left-hand side of the page copy and paste the code below below and select the `Run` button.

```sql linenums="1"
CREATE TABLE Pupils
        (`StudentNum` int, `Name` varchar(20), `Age` int, `House` varchar(10));
        
INSERT INTO Pupils
        (`StudentNum`, `Name`,`Age`, `House`)
VALUES
        (1, 'Stephen Stewart', 13, 'Nevis'),
        (2, 'Lynsey MacG', 15, 'Rannoch'),
        (3, 'Daniel Kerr', 17, 'Lochiel'),
        (4, 'Bob Jordan', 11, 'Nevis'),
        (5, 'Eilidh Ralston', 16, 'Nevis');
```

3 . Run each of the code blocks below to gain a better understanding of what each one does. 

??? example "Code Blocks"

    === "SQL"

        ``` sql title="Code Block 1" linenums="1"
        SELECT *

        SELECT * 
        FROM Pupils
        WHERE age >=16 AND house = ‘Lochiel’;
        ```
    === "Plain English"

        This will print out only the pupils who are aged greater than or equal to 16 and in guidance house Lochiel from the Pupils table.
    <br>

    === "SQL"

        ``` sql title="Code Block 6" linenums="1"
        SELECT * 
        FROM Pupils
        WHERE age >= 12 AND age <= 16;
        ```
    === "Plain English"

        This will print out only the pupils who are aged greater than or equal to 16 and in guidance house Lochiel from the Pupils table.
    <br>

    === "SQL"

        ``` sql title="Code Block 7" linenums="1"
        SELECT name, age, house 
        FROM Pupils
        WHERE age < 15
        ORDER BY age ASC;
        ```

    <br>

    === "SQL"

        ``` sql title="Code Block 8" linenums="1"
        SELECT name, age, house
