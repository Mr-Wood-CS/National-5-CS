# SQL Select Operations

For N5 you are required to be able to carry out various operations on a database using the SQL language. 

The first operations we will look at is select operations.

```sql linenums="1"
SELECT SYNTAX
SELECT column1, column2, â€¦
FROM table_name;
```
Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. 

If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:

```sql linenums="1"
SELECT * 
FROM table_name;
```
An example below shows a Pupil Info database with attributes name, age and guidance house. 

==Entity/Table Name = Pupils==

| StudentNum | Name            | Age | House
| -----------| --------------- | --- | -----
| 1          | Stephen Stewart | 13  | Nevis
| 2          | Lynsey MacG     | 15  | Rannoch
| 3          | Daniel Kerr     | 17  | Lochiel
| 4          | Bob Jordan      | 11  | Nevis
| 6          | Eilidh Ralston  | 16  | Nevis

```sql linenums="1"
CREATE TABLE Pupils
        (`StudentNum` int, `Name` varchar(20), `Age` int, `House` varchar(10));
        
INSERT INTO Pupils
        (`StudentNum`, `Name`,`Age`, `House`)
VALUES
        (1, 'Stephen Stewart', 13, 'Nevis'),
        (2, 'Lynsey MacG', 15, 'Rannoch'),
        (3, 'Daniel Kerr', 17, 'Lochiel'),
        (4, 'Bob Jordan', 11, 'Nevis'),
        (5, 'Eilidh Ralston', 16, 'Nevis');
```

## Example SQL SELECT Operations

=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title=" Select All" linenums="1"
    SELECT * 
    FROM Pupils;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out all the information in the database called Pupils using an astrix `*`
<br>
=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="Equals" linenums="1"
    SELECT *

    This will print out only the pupils who are in the guidance house Nevis from the Pupils table. Note there is speech marks around a string value.
<br>
=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title=" Greater Than" linenums="1"
    SELECT name, age 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age > 15;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the attributes name and age from the Pupils table where the age is greater than or equal to 12.
<br>
=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="Less Than" linenums="1"
    SELECT name, age 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age < 15;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the attributes name and age from the Pupils table where the age is greater than or equal to 12.
<br>
=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="Greater Than or Equal too" linenums="1"
    SELECT name, age 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age >= 12;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the attributes name and age from the Pupils table where the age is greater than or equal to 12.
<br>

=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="Less Than or Equal too" linenums="1"
    SELECT name, age 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age <= 15;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the attributes name and age from the Pupils table where the age is greater than or equal to 12.
<br>
=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="AND" linenums="1"
    SELECT * 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age >= 12 AND age <= 16;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the pupils who are aged greater than or equal to 16 and in guidance house Lochiel from the Pupils table.
<br>

=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="OR" linenums="1"
    SELECT * 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age >= 12 OR age <= 16;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out only the pupils who are aged greater than or equal to 16 and in guidance house Lochiel from the Pupils table.
<br>
=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="Show Results in Ascending" linenums="1"
    SELECT name, age, house 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age < 15
    ORDER BY age ASC;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out the attributes name, age and house from the pupils table that are less than 15 years old. The results will be sorted by the age attribute in ascending order.
<br>

=== "SQL"

    ``` sql title="Show Results in Descending Order" linenums="1"
    SELECT name, age, house 
    FROM Pupils
    WHERE age < 15
    ORDER BY age DESC;
    ```
=== "Plain English"

    This will print out the attributes name, age and house from the pupils table that are less than 15 years old. The results will be sorted by the age attribute in ascending order.
