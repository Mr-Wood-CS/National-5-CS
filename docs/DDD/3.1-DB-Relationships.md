# Database Relationships (One to Many)

Database relationships can be shown in the form of a diagram. 

This diagram is known as an 'entity relationship diagram'. 

As part of your exam, you will have to either draw or interpret one of these diagrams. 

A one-to-many relationship is the most common type of relationship between database entities. In this type of relationship, a row in table A can have many matching rows in table B, but a row in table B can have only one matching row in table A. 

For example, the publishers and titles tables have a one-to-many relationship: each publisher produces many titles, but each title comes from only one publisher.

Think about a mother and her children. A mother can have many children. A child can have only one mother.

Dog Walkers is a company that walks dogs when their owners are at work. The company has a database to store details of the dogs, their owners and the walkers. The data is stored in the following tables.

The one-to-many relationships that exist between the tables are:

* Walker and Walk - there is only one walker to many walks. For example, a dog walker can do many different walks.

* Dog and Walk - there is one dog to many walks. For example, one dog can go on many different walks.

* Owner and Dog - there is one owner to many dogs. For example, one owner may have many different dogs.

## Referential integrity

Referential integrity is a rule in relational databases that ensures relationships between tables remain valid and consistent. It prevents orphan records, meaning every foreign key in a table must match a valid primary key in another table.

For example, in a school database:

The Students table has a primary key (StudentID).

The Enrolments table records which courses students take and includes a foreign key (StudentID).

Referential integrity ensures that every StudentID in Enrolments exists in Students, preventing enrolments for non-existent students.

### Why is this important?

* Prevents data inconsistencies and errors.
* Ensures linked data remains accurate and complete.
* Maintains the reliability of relationships between tables.
