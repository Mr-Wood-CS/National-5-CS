## SQL Equi-Join Operations

You can use SQL to perform a query to show information from multiple tables where there is matching data using an equi-join to show `guidance` and `pupil information` together. The syntax can be seen below:

```pseudocode title="Equi-Join Syntax" linenums="1"
SELECT *
FROM entity1,entity2
WHERE entity1.column1 = entity2.column1;
```

Below is a separate entity/table for guidance staff information. 

==Entity = Guidance==

| EmployeeNum | Title | Surname   | House
| ------------| ----- | --------- | -----
| 1           | Mr    | Stewart   | Nevis
| 2           | Miss  | Kelly     | Locheil
| 3           | Mr    | Macdonald | Rannoch
| 4           | Mrs   | Jordan    | Shiel

The entity relationship diagram above explains the relationship between the guidance and pupils entities. One guidance teacher can have many pupils to support. The matching data and relationship between these tables/entities is the house field.

We can use an equi-join to display the pupils and guidance information together. 

```sql title="Equi-Joins" linenums="1"
SELECT * 
FROM Pupils,Guidance
WHERE Pupils.House = Guidance.House;
```

The above SQL would select all the information from the Pupils table and join it with the Guidance table. It would join the records where the house attribute on the guidance and pupils table match.
